 ## Installation
  You will want to run npm i and then open the index.js file into a terminal by doing node index.js. Once you run that command you will be asked a few questions.

 ## Usage
  This project can be used to create a list of employees with relevent data in their cards. Once you have added all of the employee types you need, the project will open a new HTML document. Open that document in your default browser and you will be greated by a clean webpage with individual cards for each employee. Each of these cards will show relevent data such as their ID, email, github, name, and office number if applicable.
